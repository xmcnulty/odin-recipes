    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>Try this roasted Brussels sprouts recipe. They come out of the oven with golden brown centers and crackly, crisp outer leaves. I love them straight off the sheet pan, but when they’re dressed with this easy Lemon, Thyme, and Parmesan seasoning, even the biggest Brussels sprouts skeptics can't resist them.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 pound Brussels sprouts, trimmed</li>
        <li>Extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to <strong>425°</strong> and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Slice brussel sprouts in half, toss with drizzles of olive oil and pinches of salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Spread coated brussel sprouts on the baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Roast 20 to 30 minutes or until tender and golden brown.</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
